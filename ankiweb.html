you must adjust the shortcut in the add-on config before you can use this.

This add-on is intended as a companion to <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1819291495" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ayxvbw/word_wrap_for_browsertable_cells_help_needed_for/" rel="nofollow">this</a> (not yet existing) add-on. So it has very limited use at the moment.
